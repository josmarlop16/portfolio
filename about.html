            <p class="about-main">
                My passion for technology has led me to pursue a degree in <strong>software engineering</strong>. 
                Through my involvement in numerous academic projects during my university years, 
                I've had the opportunity to develop both technical skills and a strong sense of teamwork.
                These academic experiences have honed my ability to <strong>work collaboratively</strong>, to <strong>work under
                pressure</strong> and <strong>ensure high-quality results</strong>. As technology is ever-evolving,
                I am enthusiastic about continuously learning, staying up-to-date, and expanding
                my knowledge base.

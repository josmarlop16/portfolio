            <h3 class="about-subtitle">I'm José Antonio, full stack developer and a commited worker.</h3>
            <p class="about-main">
                My passion for technology has led me to pursue a degree in software engineering. 
                Through my involvement in numerous academic projects during my university years, 
                I've had the opportunity to develop both technical skills and a strong sense of teamwork.
                These academic experiences have honed my ability to work collaboratively, to work under
                pressure and ensure high-quality results. As technology is ever-evolving,
                I am enthusiastic about continuously learning, staying up-to-date, and expanding
                my knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p class="about-main">
                As a dedicated and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on Front-End technologies, I bring a wealth
                of technical skills and a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. My proficiency in a wide range of
                programming languages and frameworks, including CSS, Django, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, React,
                Spring, SQL, and Styled-Components, allows me to design and build dynamic and visually appealing web applications.
                Beyond my technical expertise, I excel in effective communication, ensuring seamless collaboration with cross-functional
                teams. My methodical approach to work enables me to deliver high-quality projects on time, while my problem-solving
                skills allow me to tackle complex challenges with ease.    
            </p>
            <p class="about-main">
                In addition to my technical skills, I possess a keen eye for aesthetics, understanding the importance of user-friendly
                design and creative visual elements in web development. I am deeply committed to delivering outstanding results and
                continually improving my skills to stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
                Whether it's crafting elegant and responsive user interfaces, implementing robust back-end solutions, or solving
                intricate coding puzzles, I take pride in my ability to contribute effectively to the success of any project. I am
                passionate about the world of web development and am dedicated to creating innovative and impactful digital experiences.

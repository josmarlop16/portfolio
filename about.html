                <p class="about-main">
                    I'm José Antonio and welcome to my portfolio!! My passion for technology has led me
                    to pursue a degree in software engineering. Through my involvement in numerous academic
                    projects during my university years, I've had the opportunity to develop both technical
                    skills and a strong sense of teamwork.
                    These academic experiences have honed my ability to work collaboratively, to work under
                    pressure and ensure high-quality results. As technology is ever-evolving,
                    I am enthusiastic about continuously learning, staying up-to-date, and expanding
                    my knowledge base.

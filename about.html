            <p class="about-main">
                My passion for technology has led me to pursue a degree in <b>software engineering</b>. 
                Through my involvement in numerous academic projects during my university years, 
                I've had the opportunity to develop both technical skills and a strong sense of teamwork.
                These academic experiences have honed my ability to <b>work collaboratively</b>, to <b>work under
                pressure</b> and <b>ensure high-quality results</b>. As technology is ever-evolving,
                I am enthusiastic about continuously learning, staying up-to-date, and expanding
                my knowledge base.

            <p class="about-main">
                As a dedicated and detail-oriented <b>Full Stack Developer</b> with a strong focus on <b>Front-End technologies</b>, I bring a wealth
                of technical skills and a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. My proficiency in a wide range of
                programming languages and frameworks, including <b>CSS, Django, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, React,
                Spring, SQL, and Styled-Components</b>, allows me to design and build dynamic and visually appealing web applications.

                teams. My methodical approach to work enables me to deliver high-quality projects on time, while my problem-solving
                skills allow me to tackle complex challenges with ease. As you can see, I have a <b>high level of English</b>, 
                so I can work without problem with teams from other countries, as language will not be a problem for me.

            <p class="about-main">
                During my tenure as an Intern Fellow Software Engineer at Empathy.co, I have collaborated with various teams on a
                diverse array of projects, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as <b>Vue</b>Vue, <b>ElasticSearch</b>, and <b>Docker</b>. Notably, I
                participated in an AI project focused on semantics and machine learning to develop a Chatbot. This experience has
                significantly enhanced my technical proficiency, as well as my personal growth.

                new technologies swiftly. My project presentation skills have been refined, enabling me to communicate complex ideas
                effectively. Furthermore, I have honed my problem-solving abilities and initiative. I have also developed strong project
                management skills, utilizing industry-standard tools such as Confluence and Jira to oversee software development
                processes.

            <p class="about-main">
                My passion for technology has led me to pursue a degree in software engineering. 
                Through my involvement in numerous academic projects during my university years, 
                I've had the opportunity to develop both technical skills and a strong sense of teamwork.
                These academic experiences have honed my ability to work collaboratively, to work under
                pressure and ensure high-quality results. As technology is ever-evolving,
                I am enthusiastic about continuously learning, staying up-to-date, and expanding
                my knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p class="about-main">
                As a dedicated and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on Front-End technologies, I bring a wealth
                of technical skills and a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. My proficiency in a wide range of
                programming languages and frameworks, including CSS, Django, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, React,
                Spring, SQL, and Styled-Components, allows me to design and build dynamic and visually appealing web applications.
                Beyond my technical expertise, I excel in effective communication, ensuring seamless collaboration with cross-functional
                teams. My methodical approach to work enables me to deliver high-quality projects on time, while my problem-solving
                skills allow me to tackle complex challenges with ease.

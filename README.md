# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, where you can get to know me in an interactive way. Hope you enjoy your experience!!

## Methodology
Based on the initial requirements and the bonus points, I have developed a simple html+css web, where you can get to know me in an interactive and fresh way.

These bonus points and requirements mentioned where:
- The application has to have navigation to access different sites of the web.

- The application has to be deployed using Github Pages.

- Responsiveness: the application has a responsive design, so the webpage adapts and displays correctly on different screen sizes and devices.

- CSS Grid / Flexbox: the application implements Grid or Flexbox to create complex layouts.

- CSS Transitions / Animations: the application uses transitions or animations to make it interactive and visual.

- CSS methodology: Use a CSS methodology to organise your classes, such as BEM.

- Custom fonts: the application uses custom fonts, making it more personal and different.

- Accessibility: the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices and applying what you may have learned in UI/UX courses (such as Oviedo’s Human-Computer Interaction course):
    - Semantic HTML 

    - alt attributes in images.

    - Good color contrast between elements.

    - Tooltips on buttons and elements that have no text.

- Cross-Browser Compatibility: the application displays and behaves correctly on different browsers (chrome, firefox, safari).

## Structure
Following these points and many other good practices, I decided to use 4 html pages intead of only one page with all the information. I divided the project in 3 parts (not counting the main menu obviously):
- About, which is the page where you can get to know about my professional skills, my studies or just me in general. You can also check my CV.
- Skills, where you can check my technical skills and languages.
- Contact page, just in case you want to contact with me.


Thank you for visiting my portfolio and hope you enjoy knowing me a little more ♥️♥️♥️!
